/*
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack)

Algorithm Explanation:
1. We use DFS to traverse the tree
2. For each node, we calculate:
   - Maximum path sum from left subtree (if positive, else 0)
   - Maximum path sum from right subtree (if positive, else 0)
   - Maximum path sum that includes current node and both subtrees
3. We update the global maximum if current path sum is greater
4. We return the maximum path sum that can be extended from current node

Key insights:
- A path can go through any node and can include both left and right subtrees
- If a subtree contributes negative sum, we don't include it (take 0)
- The maximum path sum can be anywhere in the tree, not necessarily through root

Example:
       -10
      /   \
     9    20
         /  \
        15   7

Processing:
- Node 15: leftSum = 0, rightSum = 0, currentSum = 15, maxSum = 15
- Node 7: leftSum = 0, rightSum = 0, currentSum = 7, maxSum = 15
- Node 20: leftSum = 15, rightSum = 7, currentSum = 20 + 15 + 7 = 42, maxSum = 42
- Node 9: leftSum = 0, rightSum = 0, currentSum = 9, maxSum = 42
- Node -10: leftSum = 9, rightSum = 42, currentSum = -10 + 9 + 42 = 41, maxSum = 42

Final result: 42 (path: 15 -> 20 -> 7)

The algorithm finds the maximum path sum by considering all possible paths
through each node and updating the global maximum accordingly.
