/*
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack)

Algorithm Explanation:
1. The diameter of a binary tree is the longest path between any two nodes
2. This path may or may not pass through the root
3. For any node, the diameter through that node = left subtree height + right subtree height
4. We use a DFS approach to calculate heights of all subtrees
5. While calculating heights, we also keep track of the maximum diameter found
6. The height of a node = max(left subtree height, right subtree height) + 1
7. The diameter through a node = left subtree height + right subtree height (no +1 because we count edges, not nodes)

Example:
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5

For node 1: leftHeight = 2, rightHeight = 1, diameter = 2 + 1 = 3
For node 2: leftHeight = 1, rightHeight = 1, diameter = 1 + 1 = 2
For node 3: leftHeight = 0, rightHeight = 0, diameter = 0 + 0 = 0
For node 4: leftHeight = 0, rightHeight = 0, diameter = 0 + 0 = 0
For node 5: leftHeight = 0, rightHeight = 0, diameter = 0 + 0 = 0

Maximum diameter = 3 (path from 4 to 3 via 2 and 1)
